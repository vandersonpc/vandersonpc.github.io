On my most recent eBay adventure I've bought a "for parts or repair" TTI 1906 5 1/2 bench Multimeter. Buying "for parts or repair" any equipment is always a leap of faith, as you never know the equipment real condition.

For my joy the Multimeter condition was not bad at all, needing some cleaning, testing and potentially some repair.
