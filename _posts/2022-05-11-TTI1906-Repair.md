On my most recent eBay adventure I've bought a "for parts or repair" TTI 1906 5 1/2 bench Multimeter. Buying "for parts or repair" any equipment is always a leap of faith, as you never know the equipment real condition.

For my joy the Multimeter condition was not bad at all, needing some cleaning, testing and potentially some repair.

TTI ([THURLBY THANDAR INSTRUMENTS](https://www.aimtti.com)) is a British company which design and manufacture high quality electronic test equipment. The TTI 1906 is a 200000 Count[^cnt] Computing Multimeter[^bcd3] with the following characteristics:

* High brightness 5 1//2 digit LED display
* 210,000 counts auto/manual ranging
* Auto-ranging or manual ranging
* 1uV, 1mÎ© and 1nA sensitivity
* True rms a.c. ranges
* Current measurement up to 10 amps
* Null and Hold functions
* 100 reading data logger
* Wide range of computing functions: Ax+B, Hi-Lo-Pass, % deviation, min/max, dB
* Isolated RS-232 interface as standard

The TTI 1906 is a DISCONTINUED product, and more specifications can be found in the user manual available at TTI website [here](https://resources.aimtti.com/manuals/1906_Instruction_Manual-Iss8.pdf).

# Initial Test

The Multimeter overall aesthetic condition was very good considering the age of the instrument[^0323]. The basic measurements tests were performed (AC/DC Voltage, AC/DC Current and Resistance).

The following test equipment were used to perform the initial Multimeter functionality check:

* AD584K[^4f67] Precision voltage reference (2.5V, 5.0V, 7.5V and 10V)
* Precision resistive decade box
* 20MHz Signal generator (used to test AC voltage)

Voltage and resistance tests were ok. The Multimeter 5.0 Vdc measurements was very closer to the calibrated reference source voltage of **5.00226**. Same happened with the other voltage values and resistances.

While testing the current measurement functionality, a fault was found on the 200uA current measurement scale, for both AC and DC. The Multimeter measured value was way lower than the actual current.

# Repair

Once finished the functional tests, was identified that only fault found was with the 200uA AC/DC current scale.

# Disassembling the TTI 1906

The TTI1906 plastic enclosure is formed by two halves held together by four metal screws on the bottom on the unit. Once these screws removed the enclosure can be easily opened.

# Input circuit

The Multimeter schematic can be found in the [TTI1906 Service Manual]({{ site.url }}{% link files/tti1906sm.pdf %}). The schematic shows the 200uA input circuitry.

The 200uA to 200mA current shunts are contained in RP2. The 200uA scale is switched into the appropriate shunt in RP2 by MOSFET transistor F6.

V5 prevent high voltage transients from occurring if the current is fed from an inductive source when the fuse blows; these could otherwise prevent the arc from extinguishing within the fuse body which could therefore result in instrument damage. VR5 uses a TVS symbol on schematic, however physically it's a MOV (Metal-Oxide Varistor)[^afd6].

D1 to D5 protect the Multimeter current input for overload/overvoltage or connection mistakes, that may damage the switch MOSFET or the shunt resistor. In current measure mode a fuse can protect the multimeter input, however there are some limitations. One of this limitation is fuses do not blow sufficiently fast enough to protect the shunt resistor and MOSFET switch from destruction in case of a fast voltage transient. For this reason a 5-diode protection circuitry[^c6df] is added as a protection mechanism.
