On my most recent eBay adventure I've bought a "for parts or repair" TTI 1906 5 1/2 bench Multimeter. Buying "for parts or repair" equipment is always a leap of faith, as you never know the equipment real condition.

For my joy the Multimeter condition was not bad at all. Need some cleaning and maybe some repair after test.
