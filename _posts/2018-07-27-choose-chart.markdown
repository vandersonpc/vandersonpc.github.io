As Data Scientists all the time we need to present the result of our work graphically. Choose the proper chart type is mandatory in order to give means to the data that we worked, and how it can generate knowledge. 
To help on this task [Dr Andrew Abela](%20https://extremepresentation.com/design/7-charts/) published an amazing diagram to help to decide which chart best fit to a given dataset and problem to outcome.
Below is the [Dr Abela's](https://extremepresentation.com/design/7-charts/) diagram image.

You can download a pdf version on [this link](https://vandersonpc.github.io/files/choose_chart.pdf). A monochrome version of this diagram is available on [this link](https://vandersonpc.github.io/files/choose_chart_bw.pdf).

Follow are some tips for the chart format:
- No non-zero axis scale on bar charts
- Make subtle grid lines (or remove them)
- Add labels to important points
- Add descriptive, bold titles
- Position axis, scales at the right places
- Use simple, easy colors

A company called Juice Analytics crate an [online Chart Chooser application](http://labs.juiceanalytics.com/chartchooser/index.html) based on the Dr Abela's work. I suggest you check it out!

You also take a look [on this post](https://chandoo.org/wp/chart-selection-process/) which give more information about how choose the proper chart.

I hope that post be useful! Peace!!!üññüèª
