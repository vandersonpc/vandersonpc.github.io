I"<p>This project shows how to use an Arduino Pro Mini as ISP (In Circuit Serial Programmer) device. This ISP can be used to programming Arduino boards as well ATMEL/Microchip AVR microcontrollers.</p>

<p>Below is the ISP stripboard assembled with all components and the connectors and jumpers pinout. The board was created using the <a href="https://github.com/bancika/diy-layout-creator/releases">DIYLC Software</a>.</p>

<p>The picture below shown the real board assembled.</p>

<p>The LEDs can give visual feedback about the device programming process as below:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Color</th>
      <th>Function</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Red</td>
      <td>- Error occurs during the device programming</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Green</td>
      <td>- Heart Beat. Indicates ISP hardware is running</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Blue</td>
      <td>- ISP is programming the target device</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The jumpers give the options to select the baudrate (19200 or 38400) and if the target device will be powered by the ISP hardware.</p>

<p>A serial to USB converter device is required in order to connect the ISP Hardware (Arduino Pro Mini) to computer.</p>

<p>Below is the device connected to an Arduino Leonardo board and a Serial to USB converter.</p>

<p>The source code for this project and the DIYLC board files can be found <a href="https://github.com/vandersonpc/MyArduinoISP">HERE</a> on my Github page.</p>

<p>This programmer can be used with the AVRDUDE software described on <a href="/ArduinoAsISP/">this post</a></p>

<p>Enjoy it! üññ</p>
